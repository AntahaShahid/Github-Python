# import time

#Above code i write on my own.I shuffled the count-down time printing, it was taking a time
#of input seconds and then print the digit less than given second and then string pritning,
#I thought that the digit it is printing one less than given will be exact equal to given digit,
# If we add +1 with a timer,,,and this happened, ALhamdullilah.. thats where the brain opens and 
# logic building starts taking place. As my professor said: Think like a Compiler for logic building.

# NOW we reshuffle this for actual printing of count-timer ,, it is really awesome i think of it
# as a two in one kinda feature, like it also focus on time and printing:

import time
antaas=int(input("Enter time in seconds:"))

for a in range(0,antaas+1):
    print(a)
    time.sleep(1)
print("Be ready for an awesome good news")
time.sleep(2)
print("ALLAH Loves Antaha")
