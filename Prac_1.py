#Lets practice questions of shradha didi from apna college python tutorial:

# WAP to input 2 int numbers a and b.
# Print true if a is greater than or equal to b.If not print false.

a=int(input("Enter an integer a: "))
b=int(input("ENter an integer b: "))

# print("True" if a>=b else "False")
# This can also be written: 

# if a>=b:
#     print("True")
# else:
#     print("False")

# This can also be done:

print(a>=b)  # True and False can also be returned by it.
