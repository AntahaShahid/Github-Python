#Example for user age:

# age=int(input("Enter Your Age:"))

# while age<0:
#     print("Age cant be negative")
#     age=int(input("Enter Your Age:"))
# print(f"You are {age} years old")
    
    
age=int(input("Enter Your age: "))

while age<=0:
    print("Please Enter the Right Statement")
    age=int(input("Enter Your age: "))
print(f"You are {age} years old")
    
##  While Loop doesnot take more than one condition here
